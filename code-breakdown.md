# Code Breakdown: Book Recommendation System

---

## Overview

This file provides a detailed explanation of the project code for the Book Recommendation System.

---

## Sections

### 1. Import Libraries

The following libraries are used:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **SciPy (csr_matrix)**: Efficient matrix operations.
- **scikit-learn (NearestNeighbors)**: Implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.

---

### 2. Data Loading

Two CSV files are loaded:
- **BX-Books.csv**: Book metadata (ISBN, Title, Author).
- **BX-Book-Ratings.csv**: User ratings for books.

---

### 3. Data Cleaning

Steps:
1. Filter users with fewer than 200 ratings.
2. Filter books with fewer than 100 ratings.
3. Create a user-book rating matrix.

---

### 4. Model Training

The **`NearestNeighbors`** model is trained on the sparse user-book rating matrix. The distance metric used is cosine similarity.

---

### 5. Recommendation Function

The **`get_recommends`** function:
1. Takes a book title as input.
2. Finds the 5 nearest neighbors using the trained KNN model.
3. Returns the input book title and 5 recommended books with similarity scores.

---

## Challenges

1. Sparsity in the dataset.
2. Efficient handling of large-scale data.
